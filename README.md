# arma3-scripts
Collection of quality of life scripts (for now) for Arma 3 Vindicta (for now too).
The main script in there transfers the entirety of the equipment of dead units onto a container of your choice or quasi-infinite box.
This is to speed up the post-engagement looting process in Vindicta, quite useful if you're playing in very small groups or are short on time.
